api testcases checklist
Here is a checklist of test cases that can be used to test an API:

Functional testing: Test all the functionalities of the API to ensure they are working as expected. This includes testing the different HTTP methods such as GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE, as well as any other features that are specific to the API.

Positive testing: Test the API with valid inputs and expected outputs to ensure it behaves as expected.

Negative testing: Test the API with invalid inputs and unexpected situations to ensure it handles errors and exceptions properly.

Boundary testing: Test the API with inputs that are on the boundary of the input domain, such as minimum and maximum values, to ensure it behaves as expected.

Security testing: Test the API's security by evaluating its ability to protect against common threats such as SQL injection, cross-site scripting (XSS), and cross-site request forgery (CSRF).

Load testing: Test the API's performance under various loads and conditions. This includes testing the API's response time, throughput, and scalability.

Compatibility testing: Test the API's compatibility with different platforms and applications to ensure it functions correctly.

Regression testing: Test the API after making changes to ensure that new changes have not broken any existing functionality.

It's important to note that this is not an exhaustive list and the actual test cases will vary depending on the specific requirements of the API. Additionally, the test cases can be written using different testing frameworks such as JUnit, TestNG or using libraries like RestAssured for testing RESTful APIs.
