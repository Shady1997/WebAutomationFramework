web application testcases checklist
Here is a checklist of test cases that can be used to test a web application:

Functional testing: Test all the functionalities of the web application to ensure they are working as expected. This includes testing the registration, login, and logout features, as well as any other features that are specific to the application.

Usability testing: Test the usability of the web application by evaluating its ease of use, user interface, and navigation. Ensure that the application is easy to understand and use for different types of users.

Compatibility testing: Test the web application on different browsers and devices to ensure it is compatible and functions correctly. This includes testing on different versions of popular browsers such as Chrome, Firefox, and Safari, as well as on different mobile devices.

Performance testing: Test the web application's performance under various loads and conditions. This includes testing the application's response time, throughput, and scalability.

Security testing: Test the web application's security by evaluating its ability to protect against common threats such as SQL injection, cross-site scripting (XSS), and cross-site request forgery (CSRF).

Accessibility testing: Test the web application's accessibility by evaluating its ability to be used by people with disabilities.

Localization testing: Test the web application's localization by evaluating its ability to be used in different languages and regions.

Regression testing: Test the web application after making changes to ensure that new changes have not broken any existing functionality.

It's important to note that this is not an exhaustive list and the actual test cases will vary depending on the specific requirements of the web application.
