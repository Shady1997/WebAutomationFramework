why same sql query take different execution time?
There are several reasons why a SQL query may take different execution times:

The amount of data in the tables being queried can affect the execution time, as more data may take longer to process.

The complexity of the query can also affect execution time, as more complex queries with multiple joins or subqueries may take longer to execute.

The indexes on the tables being queried can also play a role in execution time, as queries that are able to use indexes will generally execute faster than those that cannot.

The performance of the database server can also affect execution time, as a server that is heavily loaded or under-powered may take longer to execute queries.

The number of concurrent queries being executed on the database can also affect execution time, as more queries may consume more resources and slow down the execution of other queries.

The disk performance, network performance, and memory allocation can also affect the execution time.

It's important to note that these are just some of the factors that can affect query execution time, and that there may be other factors that come into play in specific cases.

why same sql  query with same data size take different execution time?

Even with the same query and data size, a SQL query can still take different execution times due to a number of factors:

The state of the database and system at the time of execution can affect performance. For example, if there are a lot of other queries running concurrently, this can slow down the execution of any given query.

The indexes on the tables being queried can affect performance. If the query is able to use indexes, it will generally execute faster than if it cannot.

The optimizer of the database management system can choose different execution plan for the same query depending on the statistics of the table and indexes, leading to different execution time.

The hardware and system resources available at the time of execution can also affect performance. For example, a query may run faster on a machine with more memory or a faster CPU.

The network performance can also affect the execution time. If the query is running on a remote server, the network latency can affect the execution time.

It is important to note that these are just some of the factors that can affect query execution time, and that there may be other factors that come into play in specific cases.

why run sql query take 99 second and run it again take 5 second?
There are several reasons why a SQL query may take different execution times even when executed multiple times with the same data:

The query may be utilizing a cache. The first time the query is run, the database may need to perform a full scan of the data, but on subsequent runs, it may be able to use cached data, which can greatly speed up the execution time.

The database management system may have optimised the query execution plan. When a query is executed for the first time, the database management system will generate an execution plan based on the statistics of the table and indexes. After the first run, the optimizer may have gathered additional statistics, which can allow it to create a more efficient execution plan, leading to a faster execution time.

The database server may have been under a heavy load at the time of the first execution, but not at the time of the second execution, which can affect the execution time.

The hardware and system resources available at the time of execution can also affect performance. For example, a query may run faster on a machine with more memory or a faster CPU.

The network performance can also affect the execution time. If the query is running on a remote server, the network latency can affect the execution time.

It is important to note that these are just some of the factors that can affect query execution time, and that there may be other factors that come into play in specific cases.
