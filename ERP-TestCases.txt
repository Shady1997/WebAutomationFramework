erp testcases
ERP (Enterprise Resource Planning) test cases are a set of tests that are used to ensure the proper functionality and performance of an ERP system. These test cases are designed to validate various aspects of the system, such as data integrity, user interface, system integration, and overall performance. They are typically developed and executed by a team of QA (Quality Assurance) professionals who have a deep understanding of the system and its requirements. The test cases may include functional tests, regression tests, and system integration tests.
